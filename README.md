These files are designed to quantify the transcriptomic response to desiccation of two non-model collembolid species to desiccation stress. To do this, we used three separate approaches: 1) aligning to an annotated genome of sister species 2) align to someone else's scaffold from the RNA data 3) use Trinity to scaffold our own transcriptome and then align back to that.
